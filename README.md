# Translating machine learning–derived miRNA signatures into prognostic tools for ovarian cancer
High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the deadliest gynecological cancer, with limited treatment options, especially in low-resource settings. Traditional biomarkers, such as CA125, lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. Owing to their stability and regulatory roles in cancer, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising prognostic markers. We developed and validated a machine learning–based prognostic model for HGSOC, identifying 11 key prognostic miRNAs through feature selection and differential expression analyses. Integrated with MUC16 expression and age, the model achieved an AUC of 0.872 in the TCGA cohort, surpassing previous models. SHAP analysis identified hsa-miR-205-5p and hsa-miR-150-5p as top contributors, both linked to cancer hallmarks. External validation using RT-qPCR in an independent Brazilian cohort confirmed generalizability (AUC 0.680). This cost-effective model, compatible with routine RT-qPCR, improves prognostic accuracy by combining molecular and clinical data, enabling patient risk stratification and resource optimization in limited-resource healthcare systems.
